# VASYL STUS | Responsive Web Design Certification - Tribute Page

A basic responsive tribute page dedicated to Ukrainian poet and dissident Vasyl Stus.

## Overview
This project is part of my Responsive Web Design Certification. It involves building a tribute page following specific user stories, using HTML and CSS to create a responsive layout. The subject of the tribute page, Vasyl Stus, is a key figure in Ukrainian literature and human rights advocacy, remembered for his resistance to Soviet oppression.
